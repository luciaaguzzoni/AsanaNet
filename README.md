# AsanaNet

## Introduction
The aim of this project is to create a image classification model to detect yoga positions from videos. <br>
A possible application could be getting a list of all the positions performed during a yoga class video present on Youtube or in your computer; it is also possible to record your practices through you WebCam to get insights about it and keep track of your improvemens. <br>
A Asanas Database was also created to back up the model with information about each position.

## Libraries used
- Numpy
- Pandas
- os
- cv2
- requests, BeautifulSoup
- sklearn
- tensorflow, keras, pickle


## Database Creation
The following information were obtained for each position that the model can detect:
:
- Asana Sanskrit Name
- Asana English Name
- Difficulty level
- Pose Type
- Instructions
- Drishti (where to focus the sight)
- Cautions
- Benefits

These were collected through webscraping the site [yogapedia.com](https://www.yogapedia.com/yoga-poses). <br>
All these information are collected in the dataframe *data/asanas_df.csv*.
